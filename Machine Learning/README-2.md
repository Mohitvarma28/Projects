# Melbourne Property Price Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting property prices in Melbourne, Australia. By utilizing exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and multiple machine learning models, the goal is to accurately predict property prices and understand the key factors influencing them. The final model is optimized using hyperparameter tuning, with the best model saved for future predictions.

## **About the Dataset**
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market) contains information about property sales in Melbourne, including variables such as property type, location, size, and other features related to the sale. It has missing values, outliers, and some highly correlated variables that need to be handled during preprocessing.

- **Final Model:** CatBoost was selected as the final model due to its excellent accuracy and performance, along with interpretability through SHAP and feature importance plots.

## **Summary**
This project effectively tackled property price prediction using a systematic approach to data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building. By training multiple machine learning models and conducting hyperparameter optimization, **CatBoost** emerged as the best-performing model. Feature importance and permutation importance were explored to better interpret the model, ensuring the solution was both accurate and interpretable. The final model is robust, generalizes well, and is saved for future use.
