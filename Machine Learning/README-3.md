This project is an exploration of several clustering algorithms applied to a structured dataset. The focus is on comparing performance, evaluating different clustering methods, and analyzing their results. This project employs a variety of evaluation metrics and visualization techniques to gain deeper insights into the clustering results.

## **About the Dataset**
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) used in this project contains numerical and categorical features suitable for unsupervised learning. After preprocessing, the data is ready for application of clustering techniques, including dimensionality reduction and noise handling.

## **Project Overview**
This project involves extensive analysis of clustering techniques, from data exploration to advanced feature engineering. We utilize different clustering algorithms and compare their performance using key metrics. Visual and statistical methods are employed to evaluate and compare the quality of clusters formed by each algorithm.

## **Key Insights**
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
    - A combination of **KElbow Method**, **Silhouette Score**, **Davies-Bouldin Score**, and **Calinski-Harabasz Score** were used to evaluate and compare cluster quality across different algorithms.
    - These metrics provided comprehensive insights into how well-separated and compact the clusters were, ensuring a robust evaluation process.
- **Dimensionality Reduction and PCA:**
    - **PCA** was applied to reduce the feature space, simplifying the data while maintaining the structure for clustering. This also helped in visualizing the clusters effectively.
- **Algorithm Comparison:**
    - KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering offered good performance for more defined, spherical clusters.
    - DBSCAN and OPTICS excelled in handling noise and clusters of varying densities, while Affinity Propagation provided flexibility by determining the number of clusters automatically.
- **Statistical Analysis:**
    - Descriptive statistics (like mean, standard deviation, and quartiles) were computed for each cluster to better understand their characteristics.

## **Conclusion**
This project compared multiple clustering algorithms on a dataset using various evaluation metrics. The following key takeaways were identified:

- **Scatter Plot Comparison:** Scatter plots were used to visually compare clusters across algorithms. These visualizations revealed differences in cluster compactness and separation.
- **Metrics Comparison:** The performance of each algorithm was evaluated using Silhouette, DB, and CH Scores. KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering showed strong performance for well-separated clusters, while DBSCAN and OPTICS were better suited for complex, noisy datasets.
- **Cluster Value Counts and Statistical Analysis:** The clusters' value counts were computed, along with their statistical summaries using describe(). This helped provide a more in-depth understanding of the internal structure of each cluster.

This analysis highlights how different clustering techniques can offer distinct insights depending on the nature of the dataset, and the importance of using multiple metrics and visualization methods for a comprehensive clustering evaluation.
